The Doctor Appointment System is a web application that allows patients to search for doctors, book appointments, and leave reviews. The project is built using JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, React.js, Firebase, Redis, and Azure Queue Storage.
The system provides Google Authentication for user login and a structured appointment management system for doctors. Firebase Firestore is used as a NoSQL database, while Azure Queue Storage handles asynchronous appointment processing. Redis is implemented for caching frequently accessed data. Additionally, email notifications and role-based access control enhance security.
